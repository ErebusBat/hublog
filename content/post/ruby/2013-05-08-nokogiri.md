## Fix build warning
If getting warnings like: `WARNING: Nokogiri was built against LibXML version 2.9.0, but has dynamically loaded 2.7.8` then:

~~~ bash
gem uninstall nokogiri libxml-ruby

brew update
brew uninstall libxml2
brew install libxml2 --with-xml2-config
brew link libxml2
brew install libxslt

gem install nokogiri -- --with-xml2-include=/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include \
 --with-xml2-lib=/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib \
 --with-xslt-dir=/usr/local/opt/libxslt
