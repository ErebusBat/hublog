## Capify a Project
This page describes the basic method you can use to _capify_ a project to maintain a very flexible and easily maintainable deploy process.  This was documented/inspired in [RailsCast #337](http://railscasts.com/episodes/337-capistrano-recipes) Capistrano Recipes.

## Assumptions
This is a very opinionated process.  Some things can be easily changed, they are listed as _suggested_ as below.  Other things can not easily be changed, they are listed as _required_ below.

## Web/Application Server
The required configuration is nginx/unicorn.  However adding/changing these should just be a matter of substituting recipes that yet to be written.

### Database
Currently there are no recipes written for any database; however plans are to support MySQL and PostgreSQL

### Server
A debian based linux server is required as all of the package management tasks use `apt` commands.  Also a deploy user must be created with sudo rights before anything can be deployed.  The application will run under this user and it _should_ be the same name as the project to keep everything straight.  Although a ''set :user, 'deploy' '' can override that.
