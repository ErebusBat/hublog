## Deployment via Capistrano Recipes
This page documents what you need to do to get a project up and running on a 100% fresh installed server.
This assumes that you are using Capistrano Recipes as documented/inspired in [RailsCast #337](http://railscasts.com/episodes/337-capistrano-recipes).  

It does not help you capify a project.

## Server Prep
You must create an admin deploy user, everything else will be handled by Capistrano.

~~~ bash
sudo adduser deploy
sudo usermod -a -G sudo deploy
~~~
You should do a `shh-copy-id` or `.ssh/config` setup now.

## Capistrano Tasks

~~~ bash
cd /path/to/app
cap deploy:install deploy:setup deploy:cold
~~~
